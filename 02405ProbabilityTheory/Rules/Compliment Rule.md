### Compliment Rule
The probability of the complement of A is:
$$
P(\text{not } A) = P(A^{c}) = 1 - P(A)
$$
**Proof**
Because $\Omega$ is partioned into A and $A^{c}$, and $P(\Omega) = 1$ 
$$
1 = P(A) + P(A^{c})
$$
*Small note*: If $A=\Omega$ then $A^{c} = \emptyset$ and $P(A)=1$. This implies that $P(\emptyset)=0$. The empty set contains nothing. Also, for a set A, $P(A)= 1 - P(A^{c})$ and $P(A^{c}) \geq 0$, so $P(A) \leq 1$. Thus probabilities are always between 0 and 1
