### Rules of Proportion and Probability
**Non-negative**: $P(B)\geq 0$
**Addition**: If $B_{1}, B_{2},...,B_{n}$ is a partition of $B$ then
$$
P(B) = P(B_{1}) + P(B_{2}) + \cdots + P(B_{n})
$$
**Total one**: $P(\Omega) = 1$

A [[Distributions|distribution]] over $\Omega$ is a function of subsets of $\Omega$ satisfying these rules.

### Explanation of rules
The rules for probability are very intuitive if you think Informally of an event B as something that *might* or might not happen, and of P(B) as a measure of how likely it is B will happen.
It is agreed to measure probability on a scale of 0 to 1, which is why the **Total One** rule is important!
The addition rule says that if something can happen in different ways, the probability that it happens is the sum of the probabilities of all the different ways it can happen.
