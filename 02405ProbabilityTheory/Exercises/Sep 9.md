#### Suppose two dice are rolled. Find the propbabilites of the bollowing events
Num of distinct outcomes $\#B=36$
Formula for odds:
$$
P(A) = \frac{\#A}{\#B}
$$
Where $A$: Number of outcomes that fulfill criteria and $B$: Number of outcomes in total

**a.** Max of two dice less or equal 2
Only 1+1, can give two or less:
1/36
**b.** Max of two dice less or equal 3
Subset: {(1,1), (1,2), (2, 1)}
3/36=1/12
**c.** Max of two dice equal 3
Subset: {(1,2), (2, 1)}
2/36=1/18
**d.** Repeat b and c for *x* instead of 3
