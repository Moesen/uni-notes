# Counting Formula for P(A|B)
For a finite set $\Omega$ of equally likely outcomes, and events A and B represented by subsets $\Omega$, the conditional probability of A given B is:
$$
P(A|B) = \frac{\#(AB)}{\#(B)}
$$
the proportion of outcomes in B that are also in A. Here $AB=A \cap B = A \text{B}$ is the interesection of A and B.
