# Introduction
In a setting of equally likely outcomes, odds in favor of *A* gives the ratio between number of ways A can happen and not happen.
This can also be found through use of probabilities. Odds against *A* give the inverse ratio ($A^{-1}$). 
More generally just about any ratio of chances or probabilities can be called an odds ratio.


### The Fair Odds Rule
> In a fair bet, the payoff odds equal the chance odds 

That is another way to say, in a fair bet on an event A, when you win if A occurs and the casino wins otherwise the ratio of your stake to the casino's stake should be [[Probability#Ratio of probabilities |The ratio of probabilities]]
