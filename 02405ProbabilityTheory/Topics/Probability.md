# Introduction
A function of [[Events]] and [[Outcome Space]]
Should be seen as an extension of the idea of a Proporation
Ex: $\frac{300}{300+700}=.3=30\%$
300 men, and 700 women. If someone is picked at random, there is a 30% chance its going to be a man.

- Prob for choosing woman 70%
- [[Odds]] in favor of women are 7 to 3 ($\frac{7}{3}$)
- Odds against women are 3 to 7 ($\frac{3}{7}$)

### Ratio of probabilities
$P(A) \texttt{ to } 1 - P(A)$
