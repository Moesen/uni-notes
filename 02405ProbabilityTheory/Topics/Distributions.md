### Explanation of relation between $\Omega$ and *A*
Suppose an [[Outcome Space]] $\Omega$ is given, and that all [[Events]] of interest are represented as subsets of $\Omega$. Think of $\Omega$ as representing all ways that some situation might turn out. It is no longer assumed that $\Omega$ is a finite set, or that all possible outcomes are equally likely. But if A is an [[Events|Event]], the subset of $\Omega$ corresponding to A is still teh set of all ways that A might happen. This subset of $\Omega$ will also be denoted A. Thus [[Events]] are identified with subsets of $\Omega$.

#### Mutually exclusive

^ If $B=B_{1} \cup B_{2}\cdots B_{n}$ and the events B1...Bn are mutally exclusive.

### Example for general understanding
The term "distribution" is natural if you think of mass distributed over an area of volume $\Omega$, and P(A) representing the proportion of the total mass in the subset A of $\Omega$
