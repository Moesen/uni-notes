#### Rocket exhaust P
$$
P = \frac{1}{2}mV_{e}^{2}
$$
Where *P* is the beam/kinetic power of the rocket exhaust, *m*  is the exhaust mass flow rate, and $V_{e}$ is the exhaust velocity.

#### Thrust delivered by rocket
$$
F = m V_{e}
$$
Where *F* is the force delivered by the rocket.

#### Rocket exhaust P in other form
$$
P = \frac{1}{2}FV_{e}
$$
Using the two equations above.

#### Vehicle acceleration
"*Can also be described as vehicle thrust-to-weight ration*"
$$
F \eqsim M \alpha g_{o}
$$
Where $g_{0}$ is the Earth surface acceleration due to gravity, and $\alpha$ is the angle to the earth ($90^{o}$ being straight up).

Using this we can insert into **Rocket exhaust** equation and end up with:
$$
\frac{P}{M} = \frac{1}{2}\alpha V_{e}g_{0}
$$
